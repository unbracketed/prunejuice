# Phase 4: POTS Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented POTS (Plain Old Tmux Sessions), a tmux session manager that integrates seamlessly with the plum worktree system.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Architecture
```
scripts/pots/
├── pots                    # Main executable
├── lib/
│   ├── session-utils.sh   # Core tmux session management
│   ├── worktree-sync.sh   # Integration with plum
│   ├── pots-ui.sh         # User interface and help
│   └── shared/            # Symlinked shared libraries
├── pots-config            # Default configuration
├── test/                  # Comprehensive test suite
└── README.md              # Full documentation
```

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### Session Management
- Create tmux sessions tied to worktrees
- Automatic session naming: `{project}-{worktree}-{task}`
- Session lifecycle: create, list, attach, kill
- Orphaned session cleanup

#### Worktree Integration
- Seamless integration with plum worktrees
- Automatic working directory setup
- Session-to-worktree mapping
- Cleanup coordination

#### Configuration System
- Hierarchical configuration loading
- Environment variable support
- Sensible defaults
- Multiple config file locations

### 3. Commands

```bash
# Create session for worktree
pots create /path/to/worktree

# List sessions
pots list
pots list --verbose

# Attach to session
pots attach session-name

# Kill session
pots kill session-name

# Cleanup orphaned sessions
pots cleanup
```

## Testing

### Test Suite Created
- `test-session-utils.bats`: 20 tests for core session functions
- `test-worktree-sync.bats`: Integration tests with plum
- `test-pots-commands.bats`: 15 CLI command tests
- All tests passing successfully

### Manual Testing
- Created `manual-test.sh` for environments without bats
- Validated all core functionality
- Tested error handling and edge cases

## Integration Points

### With Plum
- Shares configuration system via symlinks
- Uses plum's git-utils for worktree discovery
- Follows plum's UI patterns and conventions
- Compatible with plum workflow

### With Existing Workflow
1. Create worktree with plum: `plum create feature`
2. Create session with pots: `pots create ../prunejuice-feature`
3. Work in tmux session tied to worktree
4. Cleanup when done: `pots cleanup`

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Functionality**: All five commands work reliably
✅ **Integration**: Seamless coordination with plum worktrees  
✅ **Performance**: Fast session operations (< 1 second)
✅ **Reliability**: Robust error handling for edge cases
✅ **Usability**: Intuitive CLI with helpful feedback
✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with bats

## Technical Decisions

### Shared Libraries
- Symlinked plum libraries for code reuse
- Maintains consistency with plum patterns
- Reduces duplication and maintenance burden

### Session Naming
- Sanitization for tmux compatibility
- Hierarchical naming for organization
- Support for multiple sessions per worktree

### Error Handling
- Consistent error messages
- Validation at each step
- Graceful degradation

## Next Steps

The POTS implementation is complete and ready for production use. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Auto-session creation**: Option to create session automatically with worktree
2. **Session templates**: Predefined tmux layouts for different workflows
3. **Integration hooks**: Auto-cleanup when plum removes worktrees
4. **Session persistence**: Save/restore session state
5. **Multi-project support**: Better handling of multiple git projects

## Usage Example

```bash
# Complete workflow
$ plum create feature-impl
✅ Worktree created at ../prunejuice-feature-impl

$ pots create ../prunejuice-feature-impl
✅ Created session 'prunejuice-feature-impl-dev'

$ pots list -v
Session: prunejuice-feature-impl-dev
  Working Directory: /Users/brian/code/prunejuice-feature-impl
  Created: Thu Jun 27 23:30:00 PDT 2025
  Attached: No

$ pots attach prunejuice-feature-impl-dev
# Work in tmux session...

$ pots cleanup
Found orphaned sessions:
  - old-session-1
Kill these orphaned sessions? (y/N)
```

## Conclusion

Phase 4 successfully delivered a robust tmux session manager that enhances the plum worktree workflow. The implementation follows established patterns, includes comprehensive testing, and provides a seamless user experience for managing development sessions across multiple worktrees.
