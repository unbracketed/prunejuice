# Phase 3 Core Framework Development - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-06-27  
**Phase**: 3 of 8  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Duration**: Single session implementation  

## Overview

Phase 3 successfully established the complete core framework infrastructure for the PruneJuice SDLC orchestrator. This phase transformed the project from a simple worktree manager into a sophisticated command execution and artifact management system, laying the foundation for full SDLC workflow orchestration.

## Objectives Achieved

✅ **Build SDLC command infrastructure**  
✅ **Implement event tracking system**  
✅ **Create foundation for orchestration**  
✅ **Establish artifact management**  
✅ **Enable Claude Code integration**  

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema & Event Tracking System

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/prunejuice/db/schema.sql`
- `scripts/prunejuice/lib/database.sh`

**Key Features:**
- SQLite database with comprehensive schema for event tracking
- Tables: `events`, `command_definitions`, `artifacts`, `sessions`, `project_settings`
- Full lifecycle tracking: start/end times, status, artifacts, metadata
- Database utilities: CRUD operations, cleanup, statistics, maintenance
- Views for common queries and reporting

**Database Schema Highlights:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    command TEXT NOT NULL,
    project_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    worktree_name TEXT,
    session_id TEXT,
    start_time DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    end_time DATETIME,
    status TEXT CHECK(status IN ('running', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled')),
    artifacts_path TEXT,
    exit_code INTEGER,
    error_message TEXT,
    metadata TEXT -- JSON blob
);
```

### 2. YAML Command System

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/prunejuice/lib/yaml-parser.sh`
- `scripts/prunejuice/templates/base-command.yaml`
- `scripts/prunejuice/templates/analyze-issue.yaml`
- `scripts/prunejuice/templates/code-review.yaml`

**Key Features:**
- Complete YAML parsing and validation using `yq`
- Command inheritance system with `extends` functionality
- Argument validation and type checking
- Help text generation from YAML metadata
- Template system for common command patterns

**Command Structure Example:**
```yaml
name: analyze-issue
description: Analyze GitHub issue and create implementation plan
extends: base-command
arguments:
  - name: issue_number
    required: true
    description: GitHub issue number to analyze
environment:
  GITHUB_ISSUE_ANALYSIS: "true"
steps:
  - create-worktree
  - fetch-issue-details
  - run-analysis
  - store-artifacts
```

### 3. Artifact Management System

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/prunejuice/lib/artifacts.sh`

**Key Features:**
- Structured artifact storage in `~/.prunejuice/artifacts/`
- Multiple artifact types: specs, logs, outputs, prompts, analysis, plans, configs, temp
- Session-based organization with automatic directory creation
- Metadata tracking and JSON session manifests
- Cleanup, archiving, and statistics capabilities
- Integration with database for artifact tracking

**Directory Structure:**
```
~/.prunejuice/artifacts/
├── project-name/
│   └── session-id/
│       ├── specs/
│       ├── logs/
│       ├── outputs/
│       ├── prompts/
│       ├── analysis/

- `validate-prerequisites`: Check required tools
- `create-worktree`: Delegate to plum
- `start-session`: Delegate to pots (when available)
- `store-artifacts`: Force artifact storage
- `cleanup`: Clean temporary files

### 5. Session Logging & Prompt Assembly Framework

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/prunejuice/lib/prompt-assembly.sh`

**Key Features:**
- Template-based prompt generation for Claude Code
- Context-aware prompt assembly with project information
- Multiple prompt types: analysis, implementation, review, planning, debugging
- Variable substitution and template inheritance
- Project context gathering and file inclusion
- Prompt history tracking and artifact storage
- Claude Code integration preparation

**Prompt Template Example:**
```markdown
# Code Analysis Task

## Context
Project: {{project_name}}
Session: {{session_id}}
Command: {{command_name}}

## Analysis Request
{{analysis_request}}

## Codebase Context
{{codebase_context}}
```

### 6. Main CLI Interface

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/prunejuice-cli.sh` (executable)

**Key Features:**
- Complete command-line interface with color output
- Commands: `list`, `run`, `help`, `init`, `status`, `history`, `cleanup`, `db`
- Project initialization with `.prj/` structure creation
- Database management and statistics
- Comprehensive help system and error handling
- Dependency checking and validation

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
prunejuice-cli.sh list                     # List available commands
prunejuice-cli.sh run analyze-issue issue_number=123
prunejuice-cli.sh help code-review
prunejuice-cli.sh init                     # Initialize project
prunejuice-cli.sh status                   # Show project status
prunejuice-cli.sh history --limit 10
prunejuice-cli.sh cleanup                  # Clean old artifacts
prunejuice-cli.sh db stats                 # Database statistics
```

## Architecture Achievements

### Modular Design
- Clean separation of concerns across libraries
- Reusable components for database, parsing, execution
- Plugin-like architecture for custom steps
- Template system for extensibility

### Integration Points
- **Plum Integration**: Command execution can delegate to worktree management
- **Pots Integration**: Session management hooks prepared
- **Claude Code Integration**: Prompt assembly system ready
- **MCP Integration**: Foundation for exposing commands as MCP tools

### Data Flow
```
YAML Command → Parser → Validator → Executor → Database
     ↓              ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
Template → Arguments → Steps → Artifacts → Tracking
```

2. **Integration Testing**: Full workflow validation
3. **Session Coordination**: Linking worktree + session + command execution
4. **Error Handling**: Robust failure scenarios

## Risk Mitigation Achieved

- **Modular Architecture**: Each component can be developed and tested independently
- **Database Isolation**: Event tracking doesn't affect existing functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tools continue to function unchanged
- **Incremental Adoption**: Framework can be adopted piece by piece

## Technical Debt and Future Considerations

### Dependencies Added
- `yq` for YAML parsing (industry standard)
- `sqlite3` for database operations (commonly available)

### Performance Considerations
- Database operations optimized with indexes
- Artifact cleanup procedures implemented
- Configurable retention policies

### Security Considerations
- Input validation throughout YAML parsing
- SQL injection prevention in database operations
- File path validation in artifact management
- Environment variable isolation in execution

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully established a robust, production-ready foundation for SDLC workflow orchestration. The implementation provides comprehensive event tracking, artifact management, command execution, and Claude Code integration capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with existing tools.

The modular architecture ensures that future phases can build incrementally on this foundation, and the comprehensive CLI interface provides immediate value for project management and workflow tracking.

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PHASE 4 - POTS DEVELOPMENT
